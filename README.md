- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Living in Madrid and working as a data scientist.
- ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· I was born in the world's most southern city: Ushuaia
- ðŸŒ± Always trying to improve my programming skills.
- ðŸ‘¯ Fun fact: I was featured in a french newspaper.

## Profesional life.

* Working as a Data Scientist in Unlimiteck Company Builder in Madrid. Work as a Python programmer developing Machine Learning models to solve Computer Vision problemas, as well as working on the backend to make sure the flow works flawlessly.

## My academic life.

* Graduated as a telecommunications engineer in 2019. 
* Got a scolarship to finish my studies in France, where I spent six months working on some machine learning projects and my thesis.
* Currently doing a masters degree in Madrid (Big Data)
* I have certified a C2 level in english and a B2 level in french.

## Online courses I've taken.

* Dataquest (all the four paths)
* MIT MicroMasters Program in Statistics and Data Science(Probability, Statistics, Machine learning with Python and Data analysis with R)
* University of Michigan - Applied Data Science with Python Specialization

## Projects I've worked on (Python) 

These projects are from when I started learning before I landed my first job with Python and don't necessarily abide by the best practices out there.

[Face recognition](https://github.com/fedllanes/facial_recognition_pi) with a Raspberry Pi Camera: Using a raspberry pi and its camera, you can add people to a dataset that later will be used to recognized those in the dataset in order to operate a door (in this case it's replaced by a LED connected to the output). The system is accessed through an interactive menu through the linux terminal. Programmed using mostly OpenCV, Dbil and Imutils

[Traffic sign recognition.](https://github.com/fedllanes/traffic/)Working with the German Traffic Sign Benchmark dataset, designed a convolutional neural network that's able to properly recognize the different traffic signs with good accuracy. Done mostly with Keras.

[Whatsapp chat analyzer.](https://github.com/fedllanes/whatssapp) Whatsapp allows you to export your chat into a txt file. Using this file, we can do some fun data analysis to get the most relevant information about our chats.

[Flight delay predictor. ](https://github.com/fedllanes/flight_delay) Using the "2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations" dataset, we analyze data about flights in the US. With this information, we want to be able to predict whether a flight will be delayed or not and on top of that, do some data analysis.

[toPNG](https://github.com/fedllanes/topng). A simple python script that turns converts pictures into pngs turning the white elements transparent.

## Projects I've worked on (R)

[Covid Analysis Argentina](https://fedllanes.github.io/R-covid-english). Using the information provided by the argentinian government, an analysis of the covid situation in Argentina, with some interactive maps and several graphs.
